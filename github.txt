On how to work with Git and Github:

Once a repo is created, clone it on terminal 

$ git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git

Go to the folder where the repository was cloned and check status

$ git status

This way the terminal will show the branch where you are working on and any changes that
have been made on the cloned files. To prepare all the files to be committed

$ git add .

or by choosing the files

$ git add filename

After preparing the files, they can be committed by

$ git commit -m 'Write a sentence showing what kind of changes were made on the files'

To send the committed files to the right path in the Github account

$ git push origin name_of_branch

Checking the branch used now

$ git branch

To create a new branch

$ git branch name_of_branch

Changing between branches

$ git checkout name_of_branch_to_go_to

Now you have a new branch with the same files of original_branch and all new changes can
be done on this branch without prejudice of the original one. All the commands described
before can be used for these new changes, until the files are pushed to Github. Once you
feel the changes are good enough, original and created branches can be compared and
merged.
